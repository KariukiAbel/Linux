In most Linux systems, your default shell is the bash shell. To fi nd out what your default
login shell is, type the following commands:

$whoami
bobsira


Although most Linux users have a preference for one shell or another, when you know how to
use one shell, you can quickly learn any of the others by occasionally referring to the shellâ€™s
man page (for example, type man bash).

The man pages provide documentation for commands, file formats, and other components in Linux.
