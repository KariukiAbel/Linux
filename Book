In most Linux systems, your default shell is the bash shell. To fi nd out what your default
login shell is, type the following commands:

$whoami
bobsira


Although most Linux users have a preference for one shell or another, when you know how to
use one shell, you can quickly learn any of the others by occasionally referring to the shell’s
man page (for example, type man bash).

The man pages provide documentation for commands, file formats, and other components in Linux.

Running Commands
The simplest way to run a command is to type the name of the command from a shell.

$ date
Sat Oct 19 08:04:00 EST 2014

Typing the date command, with no options or arguments, causes the current day, month,
date, time, time zone, and year to be displayed as just shown. Here are a few other com-
mands you can try:

$ pwd
/home/chris
$ hostname
mydesktop
$ ls
Desktop
Documents
Downloads
Music
Pictures
Public
Templates
Videos

The pwd command shows your current working directory. Typing hostname shows your
computer’s hostname. The ls command lists the fi les and directories in your current direc-
tory. Although many commands can be run by just typing command names, it’s more com-
mon to type more after the command to modify its behavior. The characters and words you
can type after a command are called options and arguments.
