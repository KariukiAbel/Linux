In most Linux systems, your default shell is the bash shell. To fi nd out what your default
login shell is, type the following commands:

$whoami
bobsira


Although most Linux users have a preference for one shell or another, when you know how to
use one shell, you can quickly learn any of the others by occasionally referring to the shell’s
man page (for example, type man bash).

The man pages provide documentation for commands, file formats, and other components in Linux.

Running Commands
The simplest way to run a command is to type the name of the command from a shell.

$ date
Sat Oct 19 08:04:00 EST 2014

Typing the date command, with no options or arguments, causes the current day, month,
date, time, time zone, and year to be displayed as just shown. Here are a few other com-
mands you can try:

$ pwd
/home/chris
$ hostname
mydesktop
$ ls
Desktop
Documents
Downloads
Music
Pictures
Public
Templates
Videos

The pwd command shows your current working directory. Typing hostname shows your
computer’s hostname. The ls command lists the fi les and directories in your current direc-
tory. Although many commands can be run by just typing command names, it’s more com-
mon to type more after the command to modify its behavior. The characters and words you
can type after a command are called options and arguments.


Understanding command syntax
Most commands have one or more options you can add to change the command’s behavior.
Options typically consist of a single letter, preceded by a hyphen. However, you can group
single-letter options together or precede each with a hyphen, to use more than one option
at a time. For example, the following two uses of options for the ls command are the same:

$ ls -l -a -t
$ ls -lat

In both cases, the ls command is run with the -l (long listing), -a (show hidden dot
fi les), and -t options (list by time).


Some commands include options that are represented by a whole word. To tell a command
to use a whole word as an option, you typically precede it with a double hyphen (--). For
example, to use the help option on many commands, you enter --help on the command
line. Without the double hyphen, the letters h, e, l, and p would be interpreted as separate
options. (There are some commands that don’t follow the double hyphen convention, using
a single hyphen before a word, but most commands use double hyphens for word options.)

Note: You can use the --help option with most commands to see the options and arguments that they support: for exam-
ple, try typing hostname --help.
